# MVP ROAD MAP

## Summary
Wanting to get to scrum based based product I am going to need to figure out how to get this product to MVP. After some thought, Creating this to be a deck analyzer first might be the best idea.

## Features that should be in the MVP

1. Deck upload.
2. Deck type analysis.
3. Combos in deck.
4. User Accounts.
5. User submitted combos.
6. User voted combos.
7. User rated Combos.
8. User card rating.
9. Comments for decks and cards

The decks will get a score based on how good the cards are and how good the combos are and best part it is community ran and voted.

Once we have this data of combos and user rated we can then build the battle system based of these reports so the AI plays more like the average keyforge player and less like me.
